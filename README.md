## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to read weather data from an SQLite database and perform queries to select temperatures from June and December.

## Results

![June temperature summary](Resources/june.png)![December temperature summary](Resources/december.png)

* The average temperature in December is less than 4 degrees colder than in June.

* The difference is slightly larger on colder days (5 degree difference at Q1).

* The difference is slightly smaller on warm days (3 degree difference at Q3).

### Summary

The results indicated that temperatures in December were not that much lower than in June, so keeping the shop open year-round does seem viable. To investigate this further, I would repeating the query for January (apparently a colder month than December in Hawaii) and also doing a query for days with rain, grouped by month.
